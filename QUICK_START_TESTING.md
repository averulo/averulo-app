# Quick Start - Test the Host Flow in 3 Steps

## For Non-Technical Testers

### Step 1: Install Expo Go on Your Phone

**iPhone users**: Search "Expo Go" in App Store and install
**Android users**: Search "Expo Go" in Play Store and install

### Step 2: Connect to the App

Ask a developer to start the server and show you a QR code.

1. Open the **Expo Go** app on your phone
2. Point your camera at the QR code
3. Tap the notification to open the app

**Important**: Your phone must be on the same WiFi as the developer's computer!

### Step 3: Test the Host Flow

1. Once the app loads, navigate to **"Become a Host"**
2. Follow the screens - there are 17 screens total
3. Fill in the forms (use fake data - it's just a test!)
4. Upload some photos from your phone
5. Complete all steps until you see the success message

**That's it!** The full test takes about 15-20 minutes.
